        <p>Regular reading doesn’t just help with your critical thinking, but it also improves your brain function. Consider what happens when you work a muscle every day. That muscle grows and becomes much stronger than before. Reading books works much the same way for your mind. Consider how many people today are affected with Alzheimer’s disease. Working your brain will make you less likely to get alzheimer’s disease. Reading doesn’t just help with your critical thinking, but it also improves your brain function.<br /><br />Reading is great fun for many people, but it also has many benefits for your mental health in the form of thinking and understanding. By concentrating on the words and the storyline, it stimulates your brain and cognitive functions. This is particularly good to teach in elementary school. This sharpening of the mind will eventually heighten your focus when concentrating on something important. Elementary school students are at the age where they can benefit a lot from this mental stimulation.</p>
